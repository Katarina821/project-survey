# Project Survey

 Projectbrief: Use React state and controlled forms to build a Typeform with a summery of the users answers in the end.
 I started by planning the 4 different questions and breaking them up into components. from there i set upp eventhandlers and statehooks in the formcomponent, passing the to following components.  I had some problems with passning the eventhandlers which tought me the value of consequent naming.
